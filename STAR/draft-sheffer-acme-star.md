--- abstract

This memo proposes two mechanisms that work in concert to allow a
third party (e.g., a content delivery network) to terminate TLS
sessions on behalf of a domain name owner (e.g., a content provider).

The proposed mechanisms are:

1. An extension to the ACME protocol to enable the issuance of
short-term  and automatically renewed certificates, and
2. A protocol that allows a domain name owner to delegate to a third
party control over a certificate that bears one or more names in that domain.

It should be noted that these are in fact independent building blocks
that can be used separately to solve completely different problems.

# Introduction: A Solution for the HTTPS CDN Use Case

A content provider (referred to in this document as Domain Name Owner,
DNO) has agreements in
place with one or more Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) that are
contracted to serve its content over HTTPS. The CDN terminates the
HTTPS connection at one of its edge cache servers and needs to present
its clients (browsers, set-top-boxes) a certificate whose name matches
the authority of the URL that is requested, i.e. that of the DNO.
However, many DNOs balk at sharing their long-term private keys with
another organization and, equally, CDN providers would rather not have
to handle other parties' long-term secrets.  This problem has been
discussed at the IETF under the LURK (limited use of remote keys) title.

This document proposes a solution to the above problem that involves
the use of short-term certificates with a DNO's name on them, and a
scheme for handling the naming delegation from the DNO to the CDN.
The generated short-term credentials are automatically renewed by an
ACME Certification Authority (CA) {{I-D.ietf-acme-acme}} and routinely
rotated by the CDN on its edge cache servers.  The DNO can end the
delegation at any time by simply instructing the CA to stop the
automatic renewal and let the certificate expire shortly thereafter.

Using short-term certificates makes revocation cheap and effective
{{Topalovic}} {{I-D.iab-web-pki-problems}} in case of key compromise
or of termination of the delegation; seamless certificate issuance and
renewal enable the level of workflow automation that is expected in
today's cloud environments.  Also, compared to other keyless-TLS
solutions {{I-D.cairns-tls-session-key-interface}}
{{I-D.erb-lurk-rsalg}}, the proposed approach doesn't suffer from
scalability issues or increase in connection setup latency, while
requiring virtually no changes to existing COTS caching software used
by the CDN.

## Cloud Use Case

A similar use case is that of cloud infrastructure components, such as load balancers
and Web Application Firewalls (WAF). These components are typically provisioned with
the DNO's certificate, and similarly to the CDN use case, many organizations
would prefer to manage the private key only on their own cloud-based or
on-premise hosts, often on Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

Here again, the STAR solution allows the DNO to delegate authority
over the domain to the cloud provider, with the ability to revoke
this authority at any time.

## Terminology

DNO
: Domain Name Owner, the owner of a domain that needs to be delegated.

NDC
: Name Delegation Consumer, the entity to which the domain name is delegated for a limited
time. This is often a CDN (in fact, readers may note the similarity of the two acronyms).

CDN
: Content Delivery Network, a widely distributed network
that serves the domain's web content to a wide audience at
high performance.

STAR
: Short-Term, Automatically Renewed X.509 certificates.

ACME
: The IETF Automated Certificate Management Environment, a certificate
management protocol.

CA
: A Certificate Authority that implements the ACME protocol.

# Protocol Flow

The protocol flow can be split into two: a STAR interface, used by NDC
and DNO to agree on the name delegation, and the extended ACME
interface, used by DNO to obtain the short-term and automatically
renewed certificate from the CA, which is eventually consumed by the
NDC.  The latter is also used to terminate the delegation, if so needed.

The following subsections describe the preconditions
({{proto-preconditions}}), and the three main phases of the protocol:

- Bootstrap: the NDC requests from the DNO the delegation of a specific name and in turn DNO asks an ACME CA to create the corresponding short-term and auto-renewed (STAR) certificate ({{proto-bootstrap}});
- Auto-renewal: the ACME CA periodically re-issues the short-term certificate and posts it to a public URL ({{proto-auto-renewal}});
- Termination: the DNO (indirectly) stops name delegation by explicitly requesting the ACME CA to discontinue the automatic renewal of the certificate ({{proto-termination}}).

This diagram presents the entities involved in the protocol and their interactions during the different phases.

## Preconditions
{: #proto-preconditions}

The protocol assumes the following preconditions are met:

- A mutually authenticated channel between NDC and DNO pre-exists.  This is called "STAR channel" and all STAR protocol exchanges between NDC and DNO are run over it.  It provides the guarantee that requests and responses are authentic.
- NDC and DNO have agreed on a "CSR template" to use, including at a minimum:
  - Subject name (e.g., "somesite.example.com"),
  - Validity (e.g., 24 to 72 hours),
  - Requested algorithms,
  - Key length,
  - Key usage.

  The NDC is required to use this template for every CSR created under the same delegation.
- DNO has registered through the ACME interface exposed by the
Certificate Authority (CA) using the usual ACME registration
procedure. In ACME terms, the DNO has an Account on the server
and is ready to issue Orders.

## Bootstrap
{: #proto-bootstrap}

The NDC (STAR Client) generates a key-pair, wraps it into a Certificate
Signing Request (CSR) according to the agreed upon CSR template, and sends
it to the DNO (STAR Proxy) over the pre-established STAR channel.  The
DNO uses the NDC identity provided on the STAR channel to look up the
CSR template that applies to the requesting NDC and decides whether or
not to accept the request. Assuming everything is in order,
it then "forwards" the NDC request to the ACME CA by means of the
usual ACME application procedure. Specifically, the DNO, in its role as an
ACME client, requests the CA to issue a STAR certificate, i.e., one that:

- Has a short validity (e.g., 24 to 72 hours);
- Is automatically renewed by the CA for a certain period of time;
- Is downloadable from a (highly available) public link without requiring any special authorization.

Other than that, the ACME protocol flows as normal between DNO and CA,
in particular DNO is responsible for satisfying the requested ACME
challenges until the CA is willing to issue the requested certificate.
Per normal ACME processing, the DNO is given back an Order ID for the issued STAR
certificate to be used in subsequent interaction with the CA (e.g., if
the certificate needs to be terminated.)

Concurrently, a response is sent back to the NDC with an
endpoint to  poll for completion of the certificate generation process. 

The bootstrap phase ends when the DNO obtains the OK from the ACME CA
and posts the certificate's URL to the "completion endpoint" where the
NDC can retrieve it.

{: #figprotoboot title="Bootstrap"}

## Refresh
{: #proto-auto-renewal}

The CA automatically re-issues the certificate (using the same CSR)
before it expires and publishes it to the URL that the NDC has come to
know at the end of the bootstrap phase.  The NDC downloads and
installs it. This process goes on until either:

- DNO terminates the delegation, or
- Automatic renewal expires.

## Termination
{: #proto-termination}

The DNO may request early termination of the STAR certificate by including
the Order ID in a certificate termination request to the ACME
interface, defined below.
After the CA receives and verifies the request, it shall:

- Cancel the automatic renewal process for the STAR certificate;
- Change the certificate publication resource to return an error
indicating the termination of the delegation to external clients, including the NDC.

Note that it is not necessary to explicitly revoke the short-term certificate.

# Protocol Details
{: #protocol-details}

This section describes the protocol's details. We start with the STAR
API between the STAR Client and the STAR Proxy.
Then we describe a few extensions to the ACME protocol running between the STAR Proxy and the ACME Server.

## STAR API

This API allows the STAR Client to request a STAR certificate via the
STAR Proxy, using a previously agreed-upon CSR template.

The API consists of a single resource, "registration". A new
Registration is created with a POST request, and the
Registration instance is polled to obtain its details.

### Creating a Registration

To create a registration, use:

    POST /star/registration
    Host: star-proxy.example.net
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "csr": "...", // CSR in PEM format
        "lifetime": 365 // requested registration lifetime in days,
                        // between 1 and 1095
    }

Upon success, the call returns the new Registration resource.

    Location: https://star-proxy.example.net/star/registration/567

### Polling the Registration

The returned Registration can be polled until the information is available from the ACME server.

    GET /star/registration/567
    Host: star-proxy.example.net

In responding to poll requests while the validation is still in
progress, the server MUST return a 200 (OK) response and MAY include a
Retry-After header field to suggest a polling interval to the client.
The Retry-After value MUST be expressed in seconds.  If the
Retry-After header is present, in order to avoid surprising
interactions with heuristic expiration times, a max-age Cache-Control
SHOULD also be present and set to a value slightly smaller than the Retry-After value.

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Retry-After: 10
    Cache-Control: max-age=9

    {
        "status": "pending"
    }

When the operation is successfully completed, the ACME Proxy returns:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Expires: Sun, 09 Sep 2018 14:09:00 GMT

    {
        "status": "valid", // or "failed"
        "lifetime": 365, // lifetime of the registration in days,
                         //  possibly less than requested
        "certificates": "https://acme-server.example.org/certificates/A51A3"
    }

The Expires header applies to the Registration resource itself, and may be as
small as a few minutes.
It is unrelated to the Order's lifetime which is measured in days or longer.
The "certificates" attribute
contains a URL of the certificate pull endpoint, see {{fetching-certificates}}.

If the registration fails for any reason, the server returns a "200 OK"
response, with the status as "failed"
and a "reason" attribute containing a human readable error message.

## ACME Authorization

The DNO MUST restrict the authorizations it requests
from the ACME server to only those that cannot be
spoofed by a malicious DNC. In most cases the DNC
will have strong control of HTTP content under the
delegated domain, and therefore HTTPS-based authorization
MUST NOT be used. See also {{restricting-cdns}}.

## Transport Security for the STAR Protocol Leg

Traffic between the STAR Client and the STAR Proxy MUST be protected with HTTPS.
For interoperability, all implementations
MUST support HTTP Basic Authentication {{RFC7617}}. However some deployments
MAY prefer mutually-
authenticated HTTPS or two-legged OAUTH.

## ACME Extensions between Proxy and Server

This protocol extends the ACME protocol, to allow for recurrent orders.

### Extending the Order Resource

The Order resource is extended with the following attributes:

    {
        "recurrent": true,
        "recurrent-total-lifetime": 365, // requested lifetime of the
                                         // recurrent registration, in days
        "recurrent-certificate-validity": 7
           // requested validity of each certificate, in days
    }

These attributes are included in a POST message when creating the order, as part of the "payload" encoded object.
They are returned when the order has been created, and the ACME server
MAY adjust them at will, according to its local policy.

### Canceling a Recurrent Order

An important property of the recurrent Order is that it can be cancelled by the domain name owner,
with no need for certificate
revocation. We use the DELETE message to cancel the Order:

    DELETE /acme/order/1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: acme-server.example.org

Which returns:


    HTTP/1.1 202 Deleted


The server MUST NOT issue any additional certificates for this Order, beyond the certificate that is available for collection
at the time of deletion.

### Indicating Support of Recurrent Orders

ACME supports sending arbitrary extensions when creating an Order, and as a result, there is no need to explicitly
indicate support of this extension. The Proxy MUST verify that the "recurrent" attribute
was understood, as indicated by the "recurrent" attribute included in the created Order.
Since the standard ACME protocol does not allow to explicitly cancel a pending Order (the DELETE operation
above is an extension),
a Proxy that encounters an non-supporting server will probably let the Order
expire instead of following through with the authorization process.

## Fetching the Certificates
{: #fetching-certificates}

The certificate is fetched from the certificate endpoint, as per {{I-D.ietf-acme-acme}}, Sec. 7.4.2
"Downloading the Certificate".
The server MUST include an Expires header that indicates expiry of the specific certificate. When the certificate
expires, the client MAY assume that a newer certificate is already in place.

A certificate MUST be replaced by its successor at the latest 24 hours before its "Not After" time.

# CDNI Use Cases

Members of the IETF CDNI (Content Delivery Network Interconnection) working group are interested in delegating
authority over web content to CDNs. Their requirements are described
in a draft {{I-D.fieau-cdni-https-delegation}} that compares
several solutions. This section discusses two particular requirements
in the context of the STAR protocol.

## Multiple Parallel Delegates

In some cases the DNO would like to delegate authority over a web site
to multiple CDNs. This could happen if the DNO has agreements in place
with different regional CDNs for different geographical regions. STAR
enables this use case naturally, since each CDN can authenticate
separately to the DNO specifying its CSR, and the DNO is free to allow
or deny each certificate request according to its own policy.

## Chained Delegation

In other cases, a content owner (DNO) delegates some domains to a
large CDN (CDN1), which in turn delegates to a smaller regional
CDN, CDN2. The DNO has a contractual relationship with CDN1, and CDN1
has a similar relationship with CDN2. However DNO may not even know
about CDN2.

The STAR protocol does not prevent this use case, although there is
no special support for it. CDN1 can forward requests from CDN2 to DNO,
and forward responses back to CDN2. Whether such proxying is allowed
is governed by policy and contracts between the parties.

# Operational Considerations

## Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs

TBD: larger logs and how to deal with them.

# Security Considerations

## STAR Protocol Authentication

The STAR protocol allows its client to obtain certificates bearing the
DNO's identity. Therefore strong client authentication is
mandatory.

When multiple NDCs may connect to the same DNO, the STAR protocol's
authentication must allow the DNO to distinguish between different
NDCs. Among other benefits, this allows to DNO to cancel a STAR
registration for one of its clients instead of all of them.

## Restricting CDNs to the Delegation Mechanism
{: #restricting-cdns}

Currently there are no standard methods for the DNO to ensure that
the CDN cannot issue a certificate through mechanisms other than the one described here,
for the URLs under the CDN's control. For example, regardless of the STAR solution, a rogue CDN employee
can use the ACME protocol (or proprietary mechanisms used by various CAs) to create a fake certificate
for the DNO's content because ACME authorizes its requests using
information that may be under the adversary's control.

The best solution currently being worked on would consist of several related
configuration steps:

 * Make sure that the CDN cannot modify the DNS records for the domain.
 Typically this would mean that the content owner establishes a CNAME resource record
 from a subdomain into a CDN-managed domain.
 * Restrict certificate issuance for the domain to specific CAs that comply
 with ACME. This assumes
 universal deployment of CAA {{RFC6844}} by CAs, which is not the case
 yet. We note that the CA/Browser Forum has recently decided to
 require CAA checking {{CAB-CAA}}.
 * Deploy ACME-specific methods to restrict issuance to a specific authorization
 key which is controlled by the content owner {{I-D.landau-acme-caa}}, and/or to specific
 ACME authorization methods.

This solution is recommended in general, even if an alternative to the
mechanism described here is used.
